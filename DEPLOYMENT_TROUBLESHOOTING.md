# üîß GitHub Actions Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: `deploy-with-ansible` job is skipped

**Problem**: The deployment job doesn't run even though the build job succeeds.

**Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Updated workflow condition to only run on `Ansible_Workflow` branch
2. ‚úÖ **Fixed**: Added correct server IP to known hosts

### Issue 2: SSH Key Format Issues

**Problem**: SSH_PRIVATE_KEY secret might have formatting issues.

**Correct Format**:
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAACFwAAAAdz...
[Your actual key content here - should be continuous lines]
...very long string of characters...
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

**How to Fix**:
1. Open your `.pem` file in a text editor
2. Copy the ENTIRE content including `-----BEGIN` and `-----END` lines
3. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
4. Update `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` with the complete key content

### Issue 3: EC2 Security Group Settings

**Required Inbound Rules**:
```
Port 22 (SSH) - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (for GitHub Actions)
Port 8080 (Frontend) - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (for users)
Port 5000 (Backend) - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (optional, for API access)
```

### Issue 4: Docker Compose Installation Error

**Problem 1**: `No package matching 'docker-compose-plugin' is available`
**Solution**: ‚úÖ **Fixed** - Removed docker-compose-plugin from apt packages.

**Problem 2**: `error: externally-managed-environment` when installing via pip
**Root Cause**: Ubuntu 24.04 has stricter Python environment management (PEP 668).

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **Fixed** - Updated to install Docker Compose using official binary download method.

**What Changed**:
```yaml
# Before (causing pip error):
- name: Install Docker Compose using pip
  pip:
    name: docker-compose

# After (working solution):
- name: Download Docker Compose binary
  get_url:
    url: "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.21.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64"
    dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    mode: '0755'
```

### Issue 6: Docker Permission Denied Error

**Problem**: `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`

**Root Cause**: User was added to docker group but SSH session needs to be refreshed for group membership to take effect.

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **Fixed** - Added `meta: reset_connection` step to refresh SSH session after adding user to docker group.

**What Changed**:
```yaml
- name: Add user to docker group
  user:
    name: "{{ ansible_user }}"
    groups: docker
    append: yes

- name: Reset SSH connection to activate docker group membership
  meta: reset_connection

- name: Test Docker access
  command: docker info
  become_user: "{{ ansible_user }}"
```

### Issue 7: Ansible Deprecation Warning

**Problem**: `community.general.yaml has been deprecated`

**Solution**: This is just a warning and doesn't affect functionality. To disable:
1. The warning can be ignored - it doesn't break the deployment
2. Or add `deprecation_warnings=False` to `ansible.cfg` if desired

## üîç Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Workflow Status
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Look for "Build, Push, and Deploy Microservices" workflow
3. Check if both jobs run:
   - ‚úÖ `build-and-push` (should complete)
   - ‚úÖ `deploy-with-ansible` (should NOT be skipped)

### Step 2: Test SSH Connection Manually
```bash
# Test SSH connection to your server
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@44.201.129.77

# If successful, you should see Ubuntu login
```

### Step 3: Check GitHub Secrets
1. Go to Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Verify `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` exists and has the complete key content

### Step 4: Check Workflow Logs
Look for these in the GitHub Actions logs:
- ‚úÖ "Setup SSH" step should succeed
- ‚úÖ "Add Known Hosts" step should add 44.201.129.77
- ‚úÖ "Verify Ansible Inventory" step should ping the server
- ‚úÖ "Run Ansible Playbook" step should deploy

## üéØ Expected Workflow Execution

### When you push to `Ansible_Workflow` branch:

1. **Build Job** (2-3 minutes):
   - ‚úÖ Build Docker images
   - ‚úÖ Push to GitHub Container Registry
   - ‚úÖ Update docker-compose files
   - ‚úÖ Commit changes

2. **Deploy Job** (3-5 minutes):
   - ‚úÖ Setup SSH connection
   - ‚úÖ Install Ansible
   - ‚úÖ Connect to 44.201.129.77
   - ‚úÖ Deploy containers
   - ‚úÖ Verify deployment

## üîß Quick Fixes

### If SSH Key is Wrong:
1. Generate a new key pair:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f aws-key
   ```
2. Add public key to EC2 instance
3. Add private key to GitHub Secrets

### If Deploy Job is Still Skipped:
Check the workflow file trigger:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ Ansible_Workflow ]  # ‚úÖ Correct
```

### If Ansible Connection Fails:
1. Check EC2 instance is running
2. Verify security group allows SSH (port 22)
3. Ensure SSH key has correct permissions

## üéâ Success Indicators

After successful deployment, you should see:
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions shows green checkmarks for both jobs
- ‚úÖ Application accessible at: http://44.201.129.77:8080
- ‚úÖ Backend API at: http://44.201.129.77:5000/health
- ‚úÖ Ansible playbook reports "SUCCESS ‚úÖ"

## üìã Next Action Items

1. **Test the updated workflow** by pushing a commit
2. **Check GitHub Actions logs** if deploy job still skips
3. **Verify SSH key format** in GitHub Secrets
4. **Test manual SSH connection** to 44.201.129.77

The workflow should now run correctly on the `Ansible_Workflow` branch! üöÄ
